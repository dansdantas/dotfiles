#  Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:

# Font family
font_family      Fantasque Sans Mono
bold_font        Fantasque Sans Mono
italic_font      Fantasque Sans Mono
bold_italic_font Fantasque Sans Mono

# Font size (in pts)
font_size        12.0

# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Thick
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium
# or
# font_family SF Mono Medium
# bold_font        SF Mono Semibold
# bold_italic_font SF Mono Semibold
# Note that you should use the full family name but do not add Bold or Italic qualifiers
# to the name.
